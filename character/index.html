<h2>Welcome!</h2>
    
    <p class="bkant">This is the Occult Guide. Simply a place to learn about an assortment of topics that have guided humanity's metaphysical experience throughout the ages; which has now mostly been regulated far from vernacular ideas.</p>
    
    <p>The Occult Guide has been contained and separated into major categories. Each of these categories will be able to make you aware of a different facet of the occult, as modern people have come to understand it.</p> 
    
    <p>Presented here is a hodgepodge of information pertaining to all things considered occult, and topics that stretch beyond. The Occult Guide is meant to be a general information source for those looking to explore this topic, understand what occultism entails and to be given some ideas of their own.</p> 

<h2>An Introduction: The Call</h2>
    
    <p>Something must have caused you to view this information, fate, destiny, happenstance, synchronicity; it is of no consequence. The important part is that you made it here, down to the opening of a possible rabbit whole into a worldview that reality is malleable through supernatural mechanism.</p>
    
    <p>Many books over the ages have been filled with information pertaining to all kinds of esoteric and occult information, such as alchemy, astrology, the power of dreams, astral travel, ritual magic, and all facets of the supernatural and paranormal.</p> 
    
    <p>In the modern context, the materialist position; that all things and processes are rooted in physicality, has become rather dominant. This kind of empiricism has led to the supernatural in general being apart of ‘mainstream’ paradigms. Although, there does appear to be a societal paradox in that as science progresses, or at least the progress of scientism, the blooming of believe in magic and other mystical things soon follows.</p> 
    
    <p>I have speculated that this might be due to disruption in how people relate to the world around them epistemologically. An example of this paradox in today’s North American society, is that trust in scientific processes and its presented paradigm are accepted as conventional wisdom, yet popular activities among people today are accepting of older tradition: astrology being one, that relies on metaphysical, and what is considered supernatural rationales. Canadians have been noted to consider astrology in a serious manner, even if widely known as “the pseudoscience of fortune-telling through the position of the planets”, which is a decayed manner of speaking of the art which captivated both Egyptian Pharaohs, and Roman Emperors.</p>

    <p>This paradox displays that the often unseen, and forgotten information in the world seeps through from time to time.</p>
