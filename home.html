<h2>The Scorched Coast</h2>
<p>The Scorched Coast is a setting contained completely within the blasted landscape of a once far more advanced society. The land is an irradiated desert where an oasis or city offers little reprieve from danger. The Scorched Coast presents the weird and unusual as mundane to its unfortunate denizens.</p>
<p>The Scorched Coast is a campaign setting for <span class="tooltip">OSR<span class="tooltiptext">Old School Revival; Old School Renaissance; Old School Rules.</span></span> roleplaying games; featuring a heavy mechanical focus on <span class="tooltip">DCC.<span class="tooltiptext">Dungeon Crawl Classics</span></span> The game occurs on the world of <span class="tooltip">Dünya,<span class="tooltiptext">The planet of The Scorched Coast. Dünya means the land or world.</span></span> the name being known only to elves, or their forgotten records. The planet itself is a warped distortion, unknown events having rendered the world little more than an over-grown asteroid. When viewed from space, the planet takes on a rectangular shape. The top and bottom faces of the planet are able to sustain living populations. Inhabitants of either side possesses little to no knowledge of the other. Despite the irregular appearance of Dünya, the planetoid is organic and not of artificial composition or construction.</p>
<p>Current life on the Coast has been shaped by a historical event of unfathomable proportions: The Great Burn. Ramifications of this little understood event have forever twisted a normal society into a land filled with mutants praying to an atomic god, dead cities lost to time, crazed monsters, and zealous cultists.</p>
<p>At an undeterminable past point in time, an event known only as The Great Burn ravaged what is now The Scorched Coast. The cataclysm’s placement and occurrence in history’s chronology is unknown, the oldest surviving calendars and dating records are never older than several hundred years. Astrologers and scholars have since created a ‘modern’ calendar whose era is defined by the amount of years that have elapsed since the occurrence of The Great Burn. AB years are all counted from the estimated happening of the cataclysm. Studious thought places approximately 486 years prior to the present day from The Great Burn; few beings or peoples know the nature of this event, its cause, or the magnitude of its destruction.</p>
<p>In the wake of total-destruction, the lands of the coast have experienced large ecological collapse. An ever-present reminder of the land’s harm is the radiation that permeates the coast’s golden sands. Visitors from other planets, or realms of existence, remark on the local inhabitant’s capability of living in the presence of such large amounts of background radiation. Grasslands hold mythological status, and all forms of life have the potential to bear mutations as a mark of The Great Burn.</p>
<p>All that is left of the former environment is a warped archeotechnical wreck crammed into a post-industrial husk. The peoples in the land view technology and magic both as wondrous. The surviving, remaining, remnants of mankind have taken to scouring the heart of the sands for treasures belonging to bygone eras. These troves remain elusive even to the remaining technological savants and esoteric magicians, the jewels of the past scream to be resurrected from their crypts.</p>
<p>Life on the coast is characterised by a myriad of perils: radiation, poisons, the elements, magic, along with terrors of the mind. An adventurer's existence is manipulated easily by both the temptations of greed, and a lust of brightly shining objects. Such flaws fill seekers with, often false, promises of obtaining fascinating baubles.</p>
<p>Along the coast, territories are controlled or subjugated by disparate rulers. A lack of large populations has discouraged, all-out, prolonged warfare; yet, brutality is often found amidst the sands. External to the conduct of small sovereigns, the larger forces of chaos threaten to subsume all of creation through the use of mortal proxies. The influence of Law is only a minor spark against the torrents of Chaos.</p>
<h2>Using The Scorched Coast</h2>
<p>The setting of The Scorched Coast can be used with any OSR or TTRPG system as wished by the GM and/or players. Even if some aspects of the setting are created for Dungeon Crawl Classics, or another roleplaying game, the information itself is malleable which can be played through different systems.</p>
<p>Made in the hexcrawl format, each hex corresponds to 6 miles, with the entire setting contained on a single hexmap. Exploration becomes paramount, seconded only by survival.</p>
<p>Regardless if a group uses The Scorched Coast as a setting onto itself, or as an accompaniment to an already existing, or created, setting the hexmap offers a drawn map with enough blanks for groups to make their "The Scorched Coast" setting unique. A judge or group can use this setting to form the beginnings of a wider world with which their group can construct together.</p>
<h2>The Game: The Last Era of the First Age</h2>
<p>Over 80 years have passed since Kallitin was engulfed by the influences of chaos, along with small populations of elves regaining their memories. Since that time, the ascendancy of Chaos has been challenged by the forces of Law; evidenced by the liberation of New Jannesburg and the dispersal of its inhabitants.</p> 
<p>The cosmic struggle, characterised by its eternal nature, has largely calmed on the Coast. Powerful champions and avatars of cosmic forces have become incarnated on the material plane, but their conflicts have yet to provide the annihilation that commonly accompanies clashes of Law and Chaos.</p> 
<p>Cults dedicated to The Twelve have begun to grow in authority and influence across the Coast, with temples being more commonplace in human predominant settlements than the past. A small number of people claim to have heard voices coming from the void, the outer dark, creating religious cults under the instruction of their otherworldly mentors.</p>
<p>The diaspora of Kallitin, having resettled across the entire coast, has managed to bolster populations of settled areas to the point where new towns and cities are beginning to form. Always under constant threat of calamity, entropy has yet to break down the few enclaves that have managed to attain even a small normalcy.</p>
